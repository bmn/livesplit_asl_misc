Miscellaneous LiveSplit Scriptable Autosplitters. See the [master branch](https://github.com/bmn/livesplit_asl_misc) for more details.

# UnMetal (PC) LiveSplit Autosplitter

## Getting Started
* Download the autosplitter using the green `Download` link in the top right of this page.
* Extract the zip contents to any location.
* In LiveSplit, add a `Scriptable Auto Splitter` component to your layout, and open its settings.
* In the SAS settings, browse to `UnMetal.asl`. The autosplitter settings should appear.

## Customising Splits
There are two approaches to making a split list:
* Split only at the end of each stage.
* Split at key moments ("events") during the stage, for more information.
 
By default, the autosplitter provides a sensible set of event splits.

To disable events, and only split at the end of stage, uncheck the `Stage Events` settings category.
