# About these split files

## Major Splits only
* Contains only the most important splits (primarily bosses)
* You must uncheck the *Full Route* split category in the autosplitter settings

## Full Route
* Contains a long, but sensible, selection of frequent splits
* Matches the default autosplitter settings - you shouldn't need to change anything

## All Splits
* Contains every split provided by the autosplitter
* Some splits occur very close to each other, so this may not be recommended without modification.
* However, this file is ideal if you want to customise your splits selection.
* Ensure you also change the autosplitter settings to match.
