# About these split files

## Major Splits
* *For new runners, or if you prefer a compact split list*
* Contains only the most important splits (primarily bosses)
* You must uncheck the *Full Route* split category in the autosplitter settings

## Standard
* *For experienced runners*
* Contains a large, but sensible, selection of frequent splits
* Matches the default autosplitter settings - you shouldn't need to change anything

## Full Route
* *For power users and information addicts*
* Contains every split provided by the autosplitter
* You should enable every split in the *Full Route* category (e.g. by right-clicking and choosing `Check Branch`)
* Ideal starting point if you want to customise your splits selection (make sure you also change the autosplitter settings to match!)
* However, some splits occur very close to each other, so this may not be recommended without modification.
